# Kinvey React-native SDK
Modified/ adapted from `kinvey-html5-sdk`, which consumes the `kinvey-js-sdk`. This repo was created to implement a different Cache Middleware, which utilizes `AsyncStorage` instead of `LocalStorage` for its caching store.

## Documentation
Refer to the [`kinvey-html5-sdk` Guides](https://devcenter.kinvey.com/html5/guides) for API usage.

## Roadmap
- This repo needs tests. We plan on bringing in the root testing and test suite from the html5-sdk, and modifying appropriately
